            <h2>Where are the deadliest mass shootings occurring in the world? Here are the surprising (and not-so-surprising) findings about mass murders by firearms.</h2>
            <br>

            <p>Mass shootings, it seems, are becoming an evern more common occurrance. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woo_Bum-kon" target="_blank">shooting spree</a> in 1982 South Korea where a policeman killed 56 people and wounded 35 others to the recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting" target="_blank">mass murder</a> in Las Vegas, the human toll continues to climb.</p>
            <p>For this project, we sought to map mass shootings across the world and identify trends. We used data from <a href="http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-deadliest-mass-shootings-in-history.html" target="_blank">World Atlas</a> and created a database which recorded the event, along with its location and number of victims. We mapped the 50 most deadly mass shootings across the world. We defined "most deadly" as having the highest death toll, which included the death of the perpetrator. Below are our findings.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Trends</h2>
            <p>Upon mapping the 50 most deadly shootings across the world in the past 40 years (starting from 1980), we saw four trends:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Infrequent mass shootings in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, followed by legislation to restrict posession of firearms, which appears to have kept the number of incidences and magnitude of the death toll relatively low.</li>
              <li>Incidents such as those in China, South Korea and Kampala, Uganda, in which police or military personnel leveraged access to firearms for their rampage.</li>
              <li>Mass shootings involving conflict and terrorism, such as those in Pakistan, Paris, Kenya, and the United States, in which a political organization uses firearms in their mass killings.</li>
              <li>Incidents in the United States and Brazil, where there are sporadic murders by lone shooters with high death tolls, but there is no legislation to further regulate possession of firearms, opening the door to future mass shootings.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Out of the 50 mapped incidents, 19 were located in the U.S. (38 percent of the total), making it the most deadly country in the world in terms of mass shootings. The second highest number of shootings was in France, which had 4 of the deadliest shootings (8 percent of the total).</p>
            <p>In terms of the number of deaths, the 401 deaths in the United States accounted for 27.6 percent of all deaths from mass shootings. The second highest cumulative death toll was in Kenya, where a total of 215 people died in mass shootings (14.8 percent of the total). It should be noted that two terrorist attacks, the Westgate Shopping Mall Attack (67 killed) and the Garissa University College Attack (148 killed), account for their entirety of Kenya's death toll in mass shootings, indicating the added complexity of the issue due to terrorism.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Part of a Larger Problem</h2>
            <p>What do all of these numbers tell us? Behind the tragedy of mass shootings is the reality of murders by firearms overall. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_06.pdf" target="_blank">CDC</a>, the United States in 2015 alone had 36,252 deaths and injuries from firearms. </p>
            <p>Although mass shootings are most often the incidents which generate collective reckoning and generate the most headlines, gun violence in its many forms&#8212;suicdes, domestic violence, and factional violence, among others&#8212;continues to rage on. These are issues which cannot solved by gun control alone. It requires a wide range of policies which will have to address domestic as well as geopolitical issues. In countries like the United States, where gun violence is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/01/the-geography-of-gun-deaths/69354/" target="_blank">predicted by inequality</a>, policies should seek to bring mental health, youth programs, and other resources to communities facing violence. Of course, the ubiquity of guns in countries such as the United States and Brazil must be addressed as well, as they contribute to higher death tolls relative to other weapons.</p>
            <p>For future analyses, we would like to categorize the shootings by incident types to account for terrorist incidents and also include injuries in addition to fatalities in our analyses. Finally, we hope to create a map accounting for shootings other than mass shootings to provide a more accurate picture of the toll of gun violence across the world.</p>
